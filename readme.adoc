WARNING: This is currently a work in progress

This repo exists out of two main parts:

* CapBot firmware that exposes a GATT server (i.e. the link:./peripheral/[peripheral])
* A client program that connects to this server (i.e. the link:./central/[central])

== Robot Control Service

A custom GATT service is used for interacting with a robot.
This service has UUID `00000030-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` and supports the following characteristics:
